Real-Time Community Crime Alert & Safety Map

A Real-Time Community Crime Alert & Safety Map is a web application designed to empower citizens and local authorities to report, track, and respond to crime and safety incidents as they happen. The platform leverages real-time data, geolocation, and community participation to improve public safety, reduce response times, and foster a collaborative approach to neighborhood security. Users can sign up, report incidents, receive alerts, and interact with local law enforcement and community members.
